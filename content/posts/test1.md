The start of an adventure... I guess? Haven't really decided it yet, but you are invited!

Okay maybe that wasn't the best way to start a blog but I'm still learning. Let's get some context before anything else.

## ðŸ‘‹ Hey!

So, after a few backs and forth I've finally done it: set up my own blog. Did I build everything by myself? No! Of course not, I've never even used NextJS before ðŸ˜…

This comes from the magic of OSS, more specifically from [nuro.dev](https://nuro.dev). Their [personal portfolio is open-source, MIT licensed](https://github.com/NuroDev/nuro.dev/), so I've just forked it and tweaked it a bit.

I really liked the modern design, with the added bonus of some click sounds. Makes it feel "cozy" - never played around with page-sounds before.

Of course, I've removed a few things I don't intend to use (referrals, timeline, dynamic projects page). They are interesting features, but I'm going for a more 'lightweight' portfolio (also, not really in the mood to post so much personal info ðŸ˜…)

## ðŸ¤” Who are you btw?

So, this is where I share some personal info, just to be polite (?).

I'm an advanced Computer Engineering student. Notice, not a SWE, but a _computer_ engineer. (actually, the translation is more like _informatics_ engineer, but sounds really weird). This means that while we study about project-management, agile methodologies and the like, we also learn about physics and electronic-engineering subjects.

In particular, we learn these things to have a firm grasp on how computers and electronics work, down to the logic gates level. We don't really learn about transistors for example, that's more Electronic Engineering stuff.

Is it useful for my career? Who knows, maybe. Am I using these things in my day-to-day tasks? Nope. Is it really cool? Of course! Learning about how these incredible devices work makes me respect all the smart people that've come before us, and keeps me curious about all the systems that we now have created! Who knows what lies ahead.

Okay, so... maybe went a bit off-track, back to the main subject: I'm specializing in distributed systems, so I've studied a bit about cloud architecture (how cloud systems are built), how to design highly-available systems (like, well... the cloud) and how to work with concurrent systems+mechanisms. I've just started to work in the industry, so I'll be looking for great people to learn from. After all, what we see in university is different from real life (or so I've been told).

## ðŸ‘Œ Okay cool, what have you done?

I've played around with many things before, mostly because I really like how vast this area can be. Just to list a few:
- Built and load-tested distributed systems in GCP.
- Played around with Unreal Engine and Unity.
- Built a multiplayer game with SDL2 and sockets.
- Webapp with SvelteKit and GunDB.
- Implemented a neural network from scratch, with Numpy.
- Implemented a highly-available system from scratch, using RabbitMQ, Docker and distributed election algorithms.
- Backend API with Flask and PostgresSQL.
- Mobile app with Expo and TensorflowJS.
- Browser game with WebGL, implementing rendering algorithms from scratch (i.e. Phong reflection model).
- Telegram and Discord bots.
- Some home automation with Tasker and Arduino :grimacing:

And probably a few more things I no longer remember. Why do I list them at all? Who knows, maybe just flexing? It's fun to sometimes look back and list things you've done.

## ðŸ¤© Nice! What will you write about?

Like every-other-dev-blog-in-the-web, most probably just about anything interesting I may find. I'd like to keep it tech-related mostly, feels more interesting to talk about. I've taught as a TA in college and really enjoyed it, so I'll probably stick to things that help others. ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

## ðŸ’­ Closing thoughts

Now that you know me, will I have your attention for a few more blog posts? Maybe I feel inspired some day and write something half-interesting. In that case, stay tuned! (you won't be able to really stay tuned because I don't have a mailing list or RSS, so... yeah, but stay tuned!).
